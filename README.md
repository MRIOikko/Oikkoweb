My personal website (Its a prototype please don't judge :') )

Hey! Sooo, this is a personal website i've been working on for like, the past 2 months.
I have clubs and stuff after school, so i've been working on it WHENVER i get the chance, and i SUCK at design and coding so this took me a while.

I had an original prototype up and running a while ago ( i can't remember when pls don't ask), and i had some other projects, and i thought about combining it all together into one nice little compact website.

I made an AI chatbot, and i thought: "Hey, how great would it be if anyone was able to access it?" 
So i added it onto my website!
I really want to add more stuff, so this is a prototype for now, and i added a page for photography, and another page for my programming projects, and another for some articles i've published on Medium!

Pretty soon i REALLY want to see if i can make a blog of sorts?  We'll see. 

But for now, go ahead and visit oikkoweb.net to see what i've been up to!  

THanks a bunch to my loony friends for helping me out.
